# final-project

Group 2 members including Mel, Jah, and Brian decided to analyze an issue of how to get book consumer's more recommendations.
We decided the best to help resolve this issue would be to create an application that could be used by both a company,and consumer.

Companies can utilize this application on the backend to collect data, and generate more recommnedations, and precise recommendations based on the consumer.

Conusmers will be able to utliize this application to enter their information by answering a short survery of questions which will ultimately provide them with more reading options moving forward.
